# Visualization_and_Logistic_regression_Titanic_dataset
Python code project: data analysis and plots of Titanic dataset, and logistic regression model. 

This code saved to this repository was inspired by a Kaggle Machine Learning project from several years ago; see link here:
<https://www.kaggle.com/wei10117/titanic-machine-learning-from-disaster/data>.

The site contains data on all of the Titanic passengers, including demographic variables such as gender, age, and also other
aspects of the passengers, such as their passenger class.

The dataset provides an interesting, if somewhat disturbing, example to demonstrate the use of logistic regression models
or other techniques for estimating probabilities using regression and/or other Machine learning methods. 

The dataset is interesting not only from a statistical standpoint, but also an historic standpoint.  For example, what factors were
the most signficant in the odds that a given passenger would survive the Titanic? Also is it actually true that women
and children were more likely to survive the Titanic? Both of these questions are addressed in the coding project saved to
this repository.

The code used involves several data science and visualization libraries, primarily Pandas, but also seaborn and statsmodels
(a regression model library).
